# Universal Hashing & Perfect Hash Tables

- In this project, we implement a universal hash function family, and 2 perfect hashing data structures, one using O(N) space, and the other using O(N2).

- We're also implemented a command line interface that allows the user to deal with a dictionary (read from a user-specified file) which is based on one of the two implementations and apply all its implemented operations of inserting, deleting, and searching.
